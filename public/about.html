<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I am JD and I want to be a successful entrepreneur using
my skills in developing software, websites, and helping local businesses in the digital aspect.
</p>

<p> I personally love to be in control with my schedule and always dreamed a life where I am
  blessed with abundance in health: physically, spiritually, and also financially. Not for myself
  but to have that opportunity to bless the lives of others especially my family and friends. 
  
  
  When I was a kid, I thought of being a pilot. Growing up, I came to understand that
  there are some things I cannot control. One of the ways I thought of is getting to a
  budget friendly, aviation school and took Aeronautical Engineering. Then in the long run
  I just felt something's off. That it wasn't for me. We had a minor subject - "Computer"
  and taught us some basic html and javascript stuff...
</p>

<p>During my junior-highschool years, I remembered creating a website for our computer project.
  It was supposed to be a group activity but turns out there were only few members in our group
  who helped me with building our website. But don't get me wrong, I had fun encoding all those HTML
  tags and building our project. We were able to make a book store out of that website, it was
  a feeling where you are tired of encoding and typing but in the end you are satified
  with your work. 
  
  Our computer project was a success, I tried to save our files in a flash drive, unfortunately,
  that flash drive got wet. I then remembered it was saved in our family's old PC. And guess what?
  Yes, the file was corrupted. 
</p>

<p>Right now, I am trying to learn again how to code and build websites. There are a lot of things that
  I do not know yet, but what I do know is that I am having fun with what I am doing. Special thanks to
  Dr. Angela Yu's program in Udemy also freeCodeCamp! I have been learning a lot. I am also looking forward
  to enroll in CourseCareers Software Development. There are a lot of ways to start in learning how to code
  and build your website, the important thing is that you stay consitent and if there is no motivation, that's 
  where discipline comes in. "Go where the opportunity is"...
